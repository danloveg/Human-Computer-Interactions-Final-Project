# Human Computer Interactions I Final Project
### Aurora 2 / UM Iris

The purpose of this project was to use user-centered design and good design prinicples to create a web application. The group I was in chose to create an updated version of the University of Manitoba's outdated course registration system, [Aurora](https://aurora.umanitoba.ca).

Prior to writing the application, months were spent brainstorming, interviewing users, and creating paper prototypes. The Human Computer Interactions course I was in was less focused on the final product we were to create and more on the design process itself.

We used HTML, JavaScript, and CSS (Bootstrap) to create our application.
