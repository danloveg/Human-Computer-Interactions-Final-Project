# Human Computer Interactions I Final Project
## Aurora 2 / UM Iris

The purpose of this project was to use user-centered design and good design prinicples to create a web application. The group I was in chose to create an updated version of the University of Manitoba's outdated course registration system, [Aurora](https://aurora.umanitoba.ca). Aurora is used to manage the courses a student is registered in, as well as show students what their schedule is.

Prior to writing the application, months were spent brainstorming, interviewing users, and creating paper prototypes. The Human Computer Interactions course I was in was less focused on the final product we were to create and more on the design process itself. The web application we created is a horizontal prototype, with three vertical components. That is, the site looks like it is all complete, but only three parts are complete. These parts are:

- The student's schedule
- A course registration function
- Updating security questions

We used HTML, JavaScript, and CSS (Bootstrap) to create our application. The project did not require that we create any persistence with a database or implement any security features.

## Testing the Website
To test, you can simply download the repository and open the `index.html` file in your favourite browser.

You will be brought to a login page. There are no credentials required to enter the website.

The homepage contains a tab for the student's schedule, the course registration page, and a tab for the user's personal information.
